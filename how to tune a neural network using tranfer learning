Today I have successfully trained a leNet to recognize the 6 categories of usa traffic signs.
The results are very good, most importantly, the network dose not get confused by a variety of background images
that look like a real traffic sign. Here the procedure to obtained the network.
1. trained the lenet using german traffic sign data base.
2. run feature extraction with dropout turned OFF!, using default learning rate(only tune the new fc layer).
3. Turn on the dropout and run fine tune with a low learning rate of 5e-4.
4. Turn on the dropout and run fine tune with a low learning rate of 1e-4.

the following one is optional. may not give good results.....(not used in this test)

5. Turn off the dropout and run fine tune with am even lower learning rate of 1e-5.
